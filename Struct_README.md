# Data_structs_Python

This repository contains a series of data structure programmed in python. 
All of the data structure programmed here are for educational purposes, but anyone is welcome to copy and use the code if you wish.
The repository itself is still being developed and data structure added but the current list includes:

- Stack
- Queue
- Linked list
- Binary Tree
- Data_structs (Data_structs is an implementation of all the data structures using inheritance)
